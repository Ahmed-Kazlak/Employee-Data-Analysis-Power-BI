# Overview:
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing Employee Data, Employee Engagement Survey Data, and Training and Development Data for a specific company. The goal was to create an insightful and interactive dashboard that provides clear visualizations and easy-to-use filters to aid in data-driven decision-making.
# Tools Used:
ETL Tool: Power Query
Analysis and Dashboards Tool: Power BI
# Data Source:
The data used in this project was provided by PSYLIQ during an internship and included multiple datasets related to employees, engagement surveys, and training programs.
# Cleaning and Preparing Process:
1. Merged all four sheets into one table.
2. Changed table names for clarity.
3. Set the first row as the header.
4. Renamed columns to meaningful names.
5. Deleted unnecessary columns for the analysis.
6. Changed data types for proper analysis.
# Analysis Process:
The dashboard was designed to provide easy filters for gender, state, employment type, and department. Key metrics and classifications include:
Number of employees, states, and average rating for all employees.
Classification of employees by their marital status.
Distribution based on payment zone, performance score, and work-life balance.
Classification of termination types.
Focus on the company's training program, including the cost of training for each department and training outcomes.
